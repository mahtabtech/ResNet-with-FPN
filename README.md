# ResNet with FPN

## Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) in Deep Learning

**Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs)** are a type of neural network architecture designed to improve the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect objects at different scales. In traditional CNNs, feature maps from deeper layers capture more abstract and high-level information, while feature maps from earlier layers contain finer, low-level details. However, using feature maps from a single layer can result in poor performance when detecting objects of varying sizes.

**FPNs** solve this problem by combining feature maps from multiple layers of a CNN. They merge **low-resolution, semantically strong feature maps** from deeper layers with **high-resolution, semantically weak feature maps** from shallower layers. This fusion creates a richer, multi-scale feature representation that significantly improves the model's ability to detect objects of different sizes and at different scales.

## Purpose of This Code

In this code, we create a **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)** using a pre-trained **ResNet-50** model. The key steps involve:

- **Loading** a pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
- **Extracting** feature maps from three different stages of the ResNet model: early, middle, and late stages.
- **Building** an FPN that merges these feature maps using upsampling and merging operations.
- **Visualizing** the feature maps to observe how the FPN enhances multi-scale feature extraction.

### Why Use an FPN?

By creating an FPN from ResNet, we leverage the hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of ResNet while enhancing its ability to handle objects of various sizes more effectively. This implementation provides:

- **Better Object Detection**: By combining features at different scales, the model becomes more robust to size variations in objects.
- **Enhanced Multi-Scale Feature Representation**: FPNs integrate fine details from shallow layers and abstract features from deep layers, improving performance in tasks requiring fine-grained recognition.

### Summary

This implementation demonstrates how to integrate a Feature Pyramid Network with a ResNet-50 model to build a more powerful model for object detection tasks. The code provides a practical example of creating and using FPNs to improve detection performance by efficiently using multi-scale features.
